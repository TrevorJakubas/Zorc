# Zorc
The classic text adventure game. Grab a brew and slay that Grue.
## The Purpose of This Project
I have always been a large fan of fantasy role-playing, and Zorc was one of the first games that i discovered on my school's computer that met that requirement. It wasn't fancy, but it allowed me to visit an entirely different dimension through a wall of text. If I can learn how to make that world from scratch it prove that I am making progress in understanding coding languages.
## Language at Use
The goal is to make this game in javascript.
